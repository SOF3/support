{ Please replace all curly braces with the appropriate information and delete this line. }

I hereby request the adverse possession of the following plugin:

https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/{ Plugin Name }

The aforementioned plugin is eligible for adverse possession because:

{ Please change [ ] to [x] for the appropriate items. }

- [ ] It is not compatible with the latest stable PocketMine-MP API { which version? } as released on { PocketMine-MP release date }, which is more than 14 days ago.
- [ ] It is not compatible with the latest Minecraft client protocol { protocol number? } as supported by the latest stable PocketMine-MP version as released on { PocketMine-MP release date }, which is more than 28 days ago.
- [ ] It is suffering from the following **bugs**, which I believe to pose significant usability issues on the users. At least one of these issues has been open for more than 28 days without response from the maintainers.
  - Links to GitHub issues here

I have offered to help update the plugin to resolve all the issues above in the pull request { link to pull request }, but there have not been any response from the maintainers with regard to the pull request. As a result, I am requesting to take over the control of this release line.

I hereby notify the previous contributors of this adverse possession request:

- { @tag all previous authors and contributors to the plugin here }

If no valid objection is received within 7 days, the permission to release updates for { Plugin name } will be permanently and irreversibly transferred to me.
